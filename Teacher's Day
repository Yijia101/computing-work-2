 teachers 
 why did you become one?
 i wonder,
 was it because of the red marks you could make?
 the satisfation that you fulfilled your childhood's dream?
 or your lifelong aspiration?
 there are so many possibilities why,
 and with that,
 many opportunities were opened up for us, your dear students.
 every insult, and every work you throw at us
 was it really so that we could improve for the better?
 I used to doubt that.
 But now i really know,
 that it was to bring the best out of us,
 So that we could have brighter and better childhoods and future than you could never have.
 selflessly giving us help
 sacrificing your youth, your time, your sleep
 while we complain about workloads of homework,
 you mark every single piece, 36 in total, through the harrowing night.
 how heroic and admirable can that be?
 I look up to you
 because i know that, 
 you are our teacher, 
 one of the very few that will never give up on us.
